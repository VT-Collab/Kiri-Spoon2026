# **Handheld Kirispoon Assembly Instructions**


## Description

The Handheld Kirispoon is a 3D-printed assistive device that functions by encompassing food with a flexible mesh. This document includes materials, tools, and instructions to reproduce the device. An order form is located at the end of this document.

### Materials
- PLA 3D-printing filament (35 grams)
- TPU (85A) 3D-printing filament (8 grams)

### Tools
- 3D printer
- Pliers (See Note in Step 2)

### Files
- LeftHandle.STL
- RightHandle.STL
- TPU Band.STL
- KirigamiMesh.STL
- GoodieStrap.STL (Optional)

## Instructions

#### 1. Download the following .STL files:
    - LeftHandle.STL
    - RightHandle.STL
#### 2. Print PLA parts
    1. On a 3D printing software, import the two files downloaded in step 1
    {{add picture}}
    2. Orient the two files onto the printer bed as shown above
    3. Adjust the printer settings to allow PLA printing
    4. Load PLA filament into the 3D printer
    5. Upload and print the two PLA parts
    6. Take the two parts off and remove the supports
        *A small pair of pliers makes removing the supports easier
#### 3. Download the following .STL files:
    - TPU Band.STL
    - KirigamiMesh.STL
    - GoodieStrap.STL (Optional)
#### 4. Print TPU parts
    1. On a 3D printing software, import the files downloaded in step 3
    {{Picture}}
    2. Orient the files onto the printer bed as shown above
    3. Adjust the printer settings to allow TPU printing
        *Note: Some printers have trouble printing TPU. Look up the best parameters for printing TPU filament on your printer.
    4. Load TPU filament into the 3D printer
    5. Upload and print the TPU parts
#### 5. Assemble

    1. Connect the two handles by aligning the two bumps located in circles in Figure (a). Imagine a line between the two bumps. Orient that line so it passes through the opening in the right handle. Slide the bumps toward each other in a straight line so that the left handle slides into the right handle. The handles should now rotate while staying connected, similar to a pair of pliers
    2. Take the kirigami sheet and locate the two circular holes on the side. Orient the kirigami sheet so that the thicker part is closer to the handles. Attach the circular holes of the kirigami sheet to the pegs on the end of the handles. These pegs can be seen in the red circles of Figure (b). The attachment will be a tight fit, but this will ensure that the kirigami sheet is snug on the handles. At this point, squeezing the handles will stretch the kirigami sheet. 
    3. Wrap the TPU band around the two remaining pegs. These pegs are in the red circles of Figure (c). The band helps the handles spring back by adding some resistance to the handles when they are squeezed. 
    4. There should now be a fully assembled Kirispoon similar to this one shown in Figure (d).
     
    - Optional Step: If the user would like some assistance holding the Kirispoon, the goodie strap can be installed on the opposite handle of the user's dominant hand. If the user is right handed, then the goodie strap would go on the left handle and vice versa. Starting from the bottom, slide the “thicker” hole of the goodie strap past the “thick” part of the handles. Then slide the remaining hole into the grooves at the bottom of the handle.

## Order List
Before clicking on the links in this list, there are some important things to note:

    - Note: The left-most column shows the number of the units to order
    - Note: The two filament spools below contain enough filament for several spoons
    - Note: This list assumes that a printer is readily available
    - Note: The specific links listed below are the materials utilized in the Kirispoon research study; it is possible to find the listed materials from other sources
    - Note: The “Link Cost” column shows the price of the product in the link address when this document was made, NOT the cost for the amount of material needed for one spoon
